### Day 2: September 04, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved 1 problem on codechef using 2 ways. Firstly by using [MAP](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/) data structure and Secondly by using hashing technique.

**Thoughts** It took me only 2 minutes for writing the code using hashing and almost an hour for map but yeah I got to learn something new today.

### Day 3: September 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved one very easy problem today and learnt about [list](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/) and [pair](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/utility/pair/) data sructures
I will do this problem using them tomorrow. 

**Thoughts** It takes me a way much time to solve a problem using data structures as compared to simple programming approaches. I more learning from today, If you fear failure then you will surely find success. You just need to try again and again.
