# 100 Days Of Code - Log
# Sumanyu Rosha
### Day 1: September 03, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Solved 3 problems from Array section and 1 problem from Strings section. Used [SET](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/) data structure in one of the problems.

**Thoughts:** After a lot of procastination, finally I have decided to take this Challenge.

### Day 2: September 04, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved 1 problem on codechef using 2 ways. Firstly by using [MAP](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/) data structure and Secondly by using hashing technique.

**Thoughts** It took me only 2 minutes for writing the code using hashing and almost an hour for map but yeah I got to learn something new today.

### Day 3: September 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved one very easy problem today and learnt about [list](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/) and [pair](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/utility/pair/) data sructures
I will do this problem using them tomorrow. 

**Thoughts** It takes me a way much time to solve a problem using data structures as compared to simple programming approaches. I more learning from today, If you fear failure then you will surely find success. You just need to try again and again.

### Day 4 : September 06, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Successfully made an algorithm to solve the problem and using [Binary Search](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/binary_search/) for it. A little more to do in it but still incomplete.

**Thoughts** Trying to make the approach efficient and understanding binary search.
